This was a group project. My code is the Finance Section which includes the following files in src/main:
BudgetController.java
FinanceSectionController.java
StockSearchController.java
Watchlist.java
WatchlistController.java
budgetData.text
personalData.text
watchlistStocks.text
Main.java


These files are responsible for the personal finance section of the app. 
The goal being to simplify tracking income/spending and a basic stock search/watchlist to encourage financial litteracy. 
This app was completed in 2 weeks so it definetely could still use some work, but it acheives the basic goal and is presentable.
