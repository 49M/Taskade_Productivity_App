This was a group project. My code is the Finance Section which includes the following files in src/main:
BudgetController.java, 
FinanceSectionController.java, 
StockSearchController.java, 
Watchlist.java, 
WatchlistController.java, 
budgetData.text, 
personalData.text, 
watchlistStocks.text, 
Main.java. 


These files are responsible for the personal finance section of the app. 
The goal being to simplify tracking income/spending and a basic stock search/watchlist to encourage financial litteracy. 
This app was completed in 2 weeks so it definetely could still use some work, but it acheives the basic goal and is presentable. 

How to run instructions:
- Open the project in an editor of your choice ex: VScode
- Make sure you have Java working
- Click Command/CTRL-Shift-b to build the app
